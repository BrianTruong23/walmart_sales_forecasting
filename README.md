## Walmart Store Prediction: Analyzing Sales Performance Metrics Across Different Store Locations

### Objective

The primary goal of this project is to analyze and understand how sales performance metrics vary across different Walmart store locations. By examining these variations, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and potential areas for improvement in sales strategies.

### Visualization Components

#### 1. Graph 1: Sales Across All Stores and Departments
This graph will provide a comprehensive view of total sales across all Walmart stores and their respective departments. It will help in understanding the overall performance and contribution of each department to the total sales.

#### 2. Graph 2: Sales Across Different Stores
This graph will focus on the sales performance of different Walmart stores. For manageability, it will display sales data from Store 1 to Store 10 only.

Additionally, this graph will include:
- **Sales Across Different Departments**: Highlighting the sales figures for various departments within these stores.
- **Sales Across Different Store Types**: Comparing sales performance based on the type of store.
- **Box Plot of Store Types**: Providing a visual summary of the sales distribution across different types of stores, illustrating the spread and central tendency of sales data.

By using these visualizations, we aim to gain insights into sales dynamics across various locations and departments, which can inform decision-making and strategic planning for improving sales performance.
